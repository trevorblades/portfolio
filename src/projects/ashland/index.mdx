_MISC_ is a 3-part visual EP by the band Ashland, directed by [Miguel Barbosa](https://yeahfilms.tv/). It is set a future where the world is facing environmental crises and certain technologies are contraband. I designed a series of PSA-style posters, video overlays, and other printed materials to help set the scene.
