I built _Beatbox Academy_ with designer Jeremy Grice at [Spring](https://springadvertising.com) in 2012. The website featured an interactive drum machine that made human beatbox noises, and elegant parallax effects between sections of informative content. It was so stunningly beatiful, and it recieved a fair bit of attention on many "cool website" websites.

Unfortunately, the site was built with Flash (back when it was "cool"??) so you might have to grant permission for Flash to run.
