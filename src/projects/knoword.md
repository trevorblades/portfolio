I created Knoword in 2010 based on a real-life game that I played with my roommate at the time and our two dictionaries. The concept is simple: Given a dictionary definition and the first letter of the word being defined, you must try to guess the word. The added challenge of typing quickly, spelling correctly, and competing against a ticking clock makes Knoword a difficult and addicting game.

Today, Knoword is used by teachers as a fun way to reinforce curriculum vocabulary and engage students in class. Teachers can create their own custom "word packs" and assign them to thier class as coursework or play them as a group at school.
