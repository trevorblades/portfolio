In 2018, I designed and built _Stories_ with my team at [Planet](https://planet.com). Stories is a tool that creates timelapse movies from Planet's deep archive of daily satellite imagery. Users can select any place on Earth and tell a story about our changing planet with just a few easy steps. The website also serves as a gallery of amazing user-generated timelapses and comparisons.
